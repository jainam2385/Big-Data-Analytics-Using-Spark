## What is spark?

-   Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
-   It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis.
-   It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

## How to install Apache Spark on Windows 10?

-   ## Prerequisites

    -   A system running Windows 10
    -   A user account with administrator privileges (required to install software, modify file permissions, and modify system PATH)
    -   Command Prompt or Powershell
    -   A tool to extract .tar files, such as 7-Zip

</br>
</br>

## Install Apache Spark on Windows

-   Installing Apache Spark on Windows 10 may seem complicated to novice users, but this simple tutorial will have you up and running.
-   If you already have Java 8 and Python 3 installed, you can skip the first two steps.

</br>
</br>

### Step 1: Install Java 8

-   Open Browser and navigate to https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp.
-   Download the latest stable version.
-   Add it to the environment variable.

</br>
</br>

### Step 2: Install Python

-   Open Browser and navigate to https://www.python.org/downloads/.
-   Download the latest stable version.
-   Add it to the environment variable.

</br> 
</br>

### Step 3: Download Apache Spark

-   Open a browser and navigate to https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html.
-   Under the Download Apache Spark heading, there are two drop-down menus. Use the current non-preview version.

</br>
</br>

## Running the project

</br>

-   Make sure Java, Python and Spark are installed correctly by running the following command.

    -   `python --version`
    -   `java --version`
    -   `pyspark --version`

-   Open the terminal/command prompt.
-   Clone the repository.
    </br>
    -   `https://github.com/jainam2385/Big-Data-Analytics-Using-Spark`
-   Next open jupyter notebook and run each cell.

</br>
</br>

## Included components:

-   Apache Spark: An open-source, fast and general-purpose cluster computing system.
    </br>

-   Jupyter Notebooks: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

    </br>
    </br>

## Featured technologies:

-   Data Science: Systems and scientific methods to analyze structured and unstructured data in order to extract knowledge and insights.
    </br>

-   Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
